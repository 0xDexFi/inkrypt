### Connection Guidelines

- Always use the most secure connection method available
- Prefer key-based authentication over password authentication
- Use `-o StrictHostKeyChecking=no` only for initial connection to test targets
- Log all authentication attempts for audit trail
- If credentials fail, do NOT retry more than 3 times
- Report any credential issues immediately in your findings
