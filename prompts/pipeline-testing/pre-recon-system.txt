## Configuration Context

{{CONFIG_CONTEXT}}

Quickly review any scan data in tool-outputs/ and map the attack surface for {{TARGET}}. Identify open ports, running services with versions, and obvious weaknesses. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write the following files to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/:

1. **service-enumeration.md** - Brief list of discovered services, ports, and versions
2. **attack-surface.md** - Key entry points with risk levels (initial draft)
3. **technology-stack.md** - OS, kernel, and primary services detected (initial draft)

## Safety Rules

- Only scan targets within scope: {{SCOPE}}
- No exploitation, no DoS, no file modification on target
