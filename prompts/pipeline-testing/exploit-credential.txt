PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Review {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/vuln-queue-credential.md and quickly demonstrate exploitability of each credential weakness. Produce minimal but reproducible proof-of-concept for each. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/exploit-results/:

**exploit-results-credential.md** - Each finding with: Status (Exploited/Partially Exploited/Not Exploitable), Service, Access gained, PoC steps, Evidence, Credential chain (if any), and Remediation.

## Safety Rules

- LIMIT auth attempts to 5 per account per service
- No data exfiltration, no password changes, no new accounts
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
