TARGET: {{TARGET}}
SCOPE: {{SCOPE}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Review pre-recon data in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/ and perform a quick deep reconnaissance pass on {{TARGET}}. Enumerate services in detail, analyze SSH configuration, and prioritize entry points. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Update/create the following files in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/:

1. **attack-surface.md** - Complete attack surface map with prioritized entry points
2. **technology-stack.md** - Detailed technology stack and version information
3. **entry-points.md** - Prioritized list of entry points with risk assessment

## Safety Rules

- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
- Reconnaissance only - no exploitation, no file modification, no service disruption
