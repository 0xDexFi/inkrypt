PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Review {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/vuln-queue-privesc.md and quickly attempt controlled exploitation of each privilege escalation vector. Produce minimal but reproducible proof-of-concept for each. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/exploit-results/:

**exploit-results-privesc.md** - Each finding with: Status (Exploited/Partially Exploited/Not Exploitable), Escalation path, PoC steps, Evidence of escalation, Impact, Cleanup steps, and Remediation.

## Safety Rules

- Only temporary files for exploitation - remove after testing
- No persistent backdoors, no data exfiltration, no pivoting
- Revert any system changes made during testing
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
