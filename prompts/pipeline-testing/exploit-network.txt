PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
SCOPE: {{SCOPE}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Review {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/vuln-queue-network.md and quickly attempt controlled exploitation of each network service vulnerability. Produce minimal but reproducible proof-of-concept for each. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/exploit-results/:

**exploit-results-network.md** - Each finding with: Status (Exploited/Partially Exploited/Not Exploitable), PoC steps, Evidence, Impact demonstrated, and Remediation priority.

## Safety Rules

- Only exploit vulns from the queue - no DoS, no data exfiltration, no backdoors
- Do NOT pivot to systems outside scope
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
