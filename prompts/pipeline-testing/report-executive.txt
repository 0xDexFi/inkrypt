PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

Review all outputs in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/ (tool-outputs/, vuln-queues/, exploit-results/, agent-logs/) and generate a concise executive penetration test report. Include overall security posture, top findings table, brief attack narrative, and prioritized remediation roadmap. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/reports/:

1. **executive-summary.md** - 1-page executive summary for leadership
2. **pentest-report.md** - Full technical report with all findings, evidence, CVSS scores, CWE references, and actionable remediation steps

## Quality Standards

- Only report confirmed findings with evidence - no false positives
- Professional tone suitable for both executives and technical teams
