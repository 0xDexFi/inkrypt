PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Quickly identify system misconfigurations on {{TARGET}} using recon data in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/. Check file permissions, user/access controls, service configs, network settings, kernel hardening, and container security. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/:

**vuln-queue-misconfig.md** - Each finding with: Severity, Category (FileSystem/Access/Service/Network/Kernel/Container/Logging), Description, Evidence, Risk assessment, and Remediation steps.

## Safety Rules

- Read-only analysis - do NOT modify system configuration or disable security controls
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
