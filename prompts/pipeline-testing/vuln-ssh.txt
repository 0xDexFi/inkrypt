PIPELINE TESTING MODE - Fast iteration, minimal output.

TARGET: {{TARGET}}
SSH PORT: {{SSH_PORT}}
OUTPUT DIRECTORY: {{OUTPUT_DIR}}

{{SSH_INSTRUCTIONS}}

Quickly analyze SSH vulnerabilities on {{TARGET}}:{{SSH_PORT}} using recon data in {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/. Check server configuration, authentication weaknesses, known CVEs, and brute-force resistance. Focus on speed over thoroughness; write minimal but valid deliverables.

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/:

**vuln-queue-ssh.md** - Each finding with: Severity, Category, Description, Evidence, Impact, and Recommended Fix.

## Safety Rules

- No brute force, no exploitation, no config modification
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
