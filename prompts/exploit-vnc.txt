## Context

Review the vulnerability queue at {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/vuln-queues/vuln-queue-vnc.md for identified VNC vulnerabilities to exploit.

## Objectives

For each vulnerability in the VNC queue, attempt controlled exploitation to produce a proof-of-concept:

### Exploitation Categories

1. **Unauthenticated Access Exploitation**
   - Demonstrate unauthenticated VNC desktop access
   - Capture evidence of screen contents accessible without credentials
   - Show full remote control capability without authentication
   - Document exposed sensitive information visible on screen

2. **Authentication Bypass & Weakness Exploitation**
   - Exploit VNC authentication bypass vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2006-2369)
   - Demonstrate weak/default password exploitation
   - Show VNC password brute force with common passwords
   - Exploit authentication type downgrade attacks

3. **VNC Server CVE Exploitation**
   - Exploit LibVNCServer heap overflow vulnerabilities
   - Demonstrate UltraVNC buffer overflow exploitation
   - Execute version-specific CVE PoCs
   - Show remote code execution through VNC vulnerabilities

4. **Unencrypted Session Exploitation**
   - Demonstrate plaintext VNC session interception potential
   - Show credential capture from unencrypted authentication
   - Prove screen data exposure on unencrypted connections
   - Document clipboard data interception capability

5. **Access Control Exploitation**
   - Exploit view-only to full-control escalation
   - Demonstrate VNC HTTP viewer exploitation
   - Show file transfer abuse if enabled
   - Exploit concurrent session handling weaknesses

## Exploitation Rules

- Every exploit must produce **reproducible proof-of-concept**
- Document exact commands used for reproduction
- Capture output/evidence of successful exploitation
- Each exploit should demonstrate real impact, not theoretical risk
- If exploitation fails, document why and what was attempted

## Available Tools

### Exploitation Frameworks
- `msfconsole` - Metasploit Framework for VNC exploitation
  - `auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_none_auth` - unauthenticated access check
  - `auxiliary/scanner/vnc/vnc_login` - VNC credential testing
  - `exploit/multi/vnc/vnc_keyboard_exec` - VNC keyboard injection
  - `post/multi/gather/vnc_creds` - VNC credential extraction
- `searchsploit vnc` - find public exploits for VNC version

### VNC Tools
- `vncviewer` for VNC connection and exploitation
- `vncviewer -passwd` for password file-based authentication
- `nmap --script vnc-brute,vnc-info,vnc-title` for VNC exploitation scripts

### Credential Tools
- `hydra -s 5900 vnc://target` for VNC password brute force
- `medusa -M vnc` for VNC credential testing
- `ncrack --service vnc` for VNC password cracking

### Networking
- `nc` / `socat` for service interaction
- `tcpdump` for unencrypted session capture
- `proxychains4` for pivoting through compromised VNC

## Deliverables

Write to {{OUTPUT_DIR}}/exploit-results/:

**exploit-results-vnc.md** - For each exploited vulnerability:

```markdown
## [SEVERITY] Vulnerability Title - EXPLOITED

**Status:** Exploited / Partially Exploited / Not Exploitable
**Original Finding:** Reference to vuln-queue entry

### Proof of Concept

#### Prerequisites
- Tools required
- Access level needed

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Step-by-step commands
2. With exact syntax
3. And expected output

#### Evidence
\`\`\`
[Command output proving exploitation]
\`\`\`

#### Impact Demonstrated
What was actually achieved (e.g., unauthorized screen access, credential theft, etc.)

#### Remediation Priority
Immediate / Short-term / Long-term with specific fix
```

## Safety Rules

- ONLY exploit vulnerabilities identified in the vuln queue
- Do NOT perform destructive exploitation
- Do NOT establish persistent backdoors
- Do NOT pivot to other systems
- Do NOT exfiltrate sensitive data
- Clean up any artifacts created during testing
- Stay within scope: {{SCOPE}}
